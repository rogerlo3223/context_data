Note from the publisher
This publication is primarily intended to provide guidance to those responsible for the design, installation, commissioning, operation and maintenance of building services. It is not intended to be exhaustive or definitive and it will be necessary for users of the guidance given to exercise their own professional judgement when deciding whether to abide by or depart from it.

Foreword
The publication of CIBSE Guide K: Electricity in buildings fills a significant gap in the range of publications produced by the CIBSE.

Work on the Guide has been carried out intermittently for more than 14 years. I wish to express my thanks to all those who have contributed their time and knowledge both under, and prior to, my Chairmanship.

Guide K is not intended as a textbook for those wishing to learn electrical engineering but rather as a reference source for engineers, architects, surveyors and other professionals who requires easy access to the information contained therein.

Similarly, it is not intended that this Guide should be read from beginning to end in one go. Instead, the reader should dip into the relevant section that is of particular interest in respect of the project in hand.

Whilst the authors and contributors have tried to produce a document that will prove to be a valuable source of reference and guidance, it is inevitable that some users will find areas that they consider should include further information. Constructive criticism and comment is welcomed in order to improve and extend the document.

Finally I wish to thank the staff of the CIBSE Publications Department and the members of the Guide K Steering Committee for their valuable assistance in the publication of the Guide.

Conductors up to 2.5 mm2 CSA are solid; larger sizes are stranded, as shown in Figure 8.7.

These cables are manufactured to BS 6004(16) for PVC/PVC
construction and BS 7211(17) for LSF/LS0H construction, with conductor sizes from 1.0 mm2 to 16 mm2. The most commonly used sizes are 1.0 and 1.5 mm2 for lighting circuits and 2.5 and 4 mm2 for small power circuits.

Larger sizes are used for higher power circuits such as cookers and electric showers.

Other cable types
8.4.8.1
Metal clad cables
This type of cable is basically a group of single core cables pre-assembled into a flexible steel conduit as shown in Figure 8.11. Metal clad (MC) cable has been used for many years in North America but has only recently been used in the UK. At present there is no applicable British Standard although several MC cables have been certified by BASEC.

Termination is very simple with the external sheath being cut to length and clamped into a proprietary gland. A small plastic bush is installed over the cut end of the metal cladding to prevent damage to the conductor insulation.

Manufacturers quote the minimum bending radius as a
multiple of the overall diameter of the cable, normally about eight times the diameter. With large multicore armoured cables it is difficult to bend the cables to the minimum bending radius without a former and, possibly, mechanical assistance. However, with smaller cables, up to about 15 or 20 mm overall diameter, it is quite easy to bend the cable to a smaller radius by hand and it may suffer damage as a result.

Terminations
The word âterminationâ covers both the connection of the conductors to the terminals of the equipment and, in the case of multicore cables, the mechanical connection of the cable sheath and armouring.

The Wiring Regulations(1) do not define the term âjointâ

Joints will normally only be necessary in one of two circumstances:

Because of the electrical inhomogeneity of the body, the current density should be averaged over a section 1 cm2, normal to the current flow. For frequencies up to 100 kHz and for pulsed magnetic fields, the maximum current density can be calculated from the rise/fall times, and the maximum rate of change of magnetic flux density. The induced current density can then be compared with the appropriate basic restriction.
